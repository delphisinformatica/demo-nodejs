* Delphis Informatica Demo App for Openshift

All boilerplate code managed by [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) framework adhering to DRY rule. Routes are defined in routes/index.js file, static view pages are in views folder. I have implemented partials concept to avoid code redundancy in html using EJS view engine. Css and Javascript files are stored in public folder.
